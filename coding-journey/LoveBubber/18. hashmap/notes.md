# hash

- it is a data structure, which store data in a key-pair.
- insertion, deletion, updating : O(1)

# bucket Arr:

    - store hash data inside the array know as bucket array

# hash code

    - conversation work by hash code e.g. string to no
    - two work --> conversion & uniform distribution

# compression function:

    - hash code number ko range me lana by compression function

# collision:

    - same letter string give the same number

# collision handling:

    - open hashing --> same place pe hi jao
    - closed addressing

# complexity analysis
